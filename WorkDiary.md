1. put the NASA output into a separate component in a separate file.  

using this as an example. 

https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana/FrontEndForStudents/blob/main/ReactJSForStudents/StarterNASAAPODReactJS/src/NASAAPOD/APODWithAPI.js

Moved NASA code to separate component. 

App.js now only has components and nothing else. 

That is Phase Four complete. 


# September 4th 2022

Started this project. 

GamePlan 

I want to get the API server. (our focus is React JS axios, so, right now we will just copy, the API server)
Note : later, we have to build the API server also. 

I got the API server from this link. 

https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana/NodeJSForStudents/tree/main/MongoDB_API_CRUD_HelloWorld

Next 

run the API server. 
test it with postman. 

1. dummycarwithlodash is working fine. 
1. returnsomemovieswithoutindexing 

we have a problem. dummycarwithlodash is working. 

but, movies is not working. 

Problem?

1. database is down. 
1. database connection is not good. 

IP address was the problem. 
added current IP address from mongo db dashboard. 

Now, 

1. run the API server. DONE.
1. test it with postman. DONE.

Next 

Build the React JS project. 

we have a simple hello world project.

https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana/FrontEndForStudents/tree/main/ReactJSForStudents/httpshelloworld

I have got it. 

simple hello world HTTPS is running. 

Now, basic things are ready. 

1. API Server is ready. 
1. Postman is ready. 
1. mongo db is ready.
1. basic react js is ready.

First Phase is complete. 

Phase Two

1. we need to make a simple ‘api call’ using axios.
1. we should show the information on the React JS web app using react component.

let's look at this button 

https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana/FrontEndForStudents/blob/main/ReactJSForStudents/axioshelloworldhttps/src/components/GetSomethingWithButton.js

first, we need to install axios. 

```
    npm install axios
```

first step 

1. we need to make a simple ‘api call’ using axios.

we are getting NASA API data. 

1. Show the NASA data on the web app. 
1. useEffect
1. useState. 


it's working. 

simple button, getting NASA data and showing NASA data. 

Phase Two is completed.
