Started this project. 

GamePlan 

I want to get the API server. (our focus is React JS axios, so, right now we will just copy, the API server)
Note : later, we have to build the API server also. 

I got the API server from this link. 

https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana/NodeJSForStudents/tree/main/MongoDB_API_CRUD_HelloWorld

Next 

run the API server. 
test it with postman. 

1. dummycarwithlodash is working fine. 
1. returnsomemovieswithoutindexing 

we have a problem. dummycarwithlodash is working. 

but, movies is not working. 

Problem?

1. database is down. 
1. database connection is not good. 

IP address was the problem. 
added current IP address from mongo db dashboard. 

Now, 

1. run the API server. DONE.
1. test it with postman. DONE.

Next 

Build the React JS project. 

we have a simple hello world project.

https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana/FrontEndForStudents/tree/main/ReactJSForStudents/httpshelloworld

I have got it. 

simple hello world HTTPS is running. 

Now, basic things are ready. 

1. API Server is ready. 
1. Postman is ready. 
1. mongo db is ready.
1. basic react js is ready.

First Phase is complete.
